## How to Play

Find My Hat is a simple labyrinth game.  
The terminal will display a 10x10 field, unexplored field (`â–‘`), holes where you can fall (`O`), and a hat (`^`).  
You will start in the top-left corner and your character will be marked with an asterisk (`*`).  
You will need to walk until you find your hat, but be careful! If you leave the field or fall in a hole you will lose.
